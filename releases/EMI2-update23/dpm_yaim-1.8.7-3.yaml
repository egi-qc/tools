  The Disk Pool Manager (DPM) is a lightweight storage solution for grid sites. It offers a
  simple way to create a disk-based grid storage element and supports relevant protocols
  (SRM, gridFTP, RFIO) for file management and access. It focus on manageability (ease
  of installation, configuration, low effort of maintenance), while providing all required
  functionality for a grid storage solution (support for multiple disk server nodes,
  different space types, multiple file replicas in disk pools).

changelog: |
  dpm-yaim has been upgraded from 4.2.17 to 4.2.20
  dpm-yaim 4.2.20 is a maintenance release to address some specific problems. If your DPM is running there is no need to rerun yaim with this new version of the dpm yaim scripts.
dpm-yaim 4.2.20 changes:
  Add MALLOC_ARENA_MAX setting for xrootd in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd.(A recommendation from XRootD team).
  Enable to dpm's synchronous get feature in /etc/sysconfig/dpm
  When configuring xroot, http or https add the protocol name to /etc/shift.conf. This is to allow recent versions of dpm's srm to respond with turls for those protocols.
  Configure dmlite to use plugin_fs_rfio with the most recent version of dmlite-plugins-adapter is installed, otherwise it configures plugin_fs_io.
  add log_level to /etc/gridftp.conf. This is needed for the most recent gridftp server, where the debug level is no longer set by the init.d script.
  Add label to /etc/gai.conf to allow srm and gridftp to bind to ipv6 sockets
